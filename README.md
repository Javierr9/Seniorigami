Accessibility is our main concern since our main target user is the elderly. We really take a lot of consideration in choosing our color palette. 

To choose our color palette, we start from the color that most elderly like which is Pink *(we use a pinkish coral)*. Then we determine other colors with the help of Sim Daltonism, to simulate what the elderly see, and choosing whatâ€™s the best for them *(distinguishable)* while still looks good to people with normal vision.
